### Directions:

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed. Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

### Examples:

```javascript
Test.assertEquals(spinWords("Hey fellow people"), "Hey wollef elpoep");
Test.assertEquals(spinWords("Hi my name is Larry"), "Hi my name is yrraL");
```
