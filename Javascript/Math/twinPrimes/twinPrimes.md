### Directions:

A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime numberâ€”for example, either member of the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. Sometimes the term twin prime is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a function that counts the number of sets of twin primes from 1 to n.

If n is wrapped by twin primes (n-1 == prime && n+1 == prime) then that should also count even though n+1 is outside the range.

Ex n = 10

Twin Primes are (3,5) (5,7) so your function should return 2!

### Examples:

```javascript
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(10), 2);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(15), 3);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(2), 0);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(8000), 175);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(2500), 72);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(0), 0);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(25), 4);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(1), 0);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(48962), 687);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(-25), 0);
Test.assertSimilar(twinPrime(25000), 408);
