### Directions:

I have the par value for each hole on the golf course and my stroke score on each hole. Im tired of calculating it by hand. Can you write a program that calculates my golf score for me?

Rules:

Golf Score & Par Score will be strings.

Golf Score length and Par Score length will always match.

### Examples:

```javascript
Test.assertEquals(golfScoreCalculator('443454444344544443', '353445334534445344'), -1);
```
