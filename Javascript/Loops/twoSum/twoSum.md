### Directions:

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.


#### Example:

```javascript
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 17;

twoSum(nums, target); // => [0, 3]
```
