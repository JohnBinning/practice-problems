### Directions:

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "Hello there!!" would become "Hll thr!".

### Examples:

```ruby
Test.assert_equals(disemvowel("This is a sentence!"), "Ths s  sntnc!")
Test.assert_equals(disemvowel("Hello there!"), "Hll thr!")
Test.assert_equals(disemvowel("Don't forget to include CAPITALS!"), "Dn't frgt t ncld CPTLS!")
```
