### Directions:

Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

Then l + o + v + e = 54

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

So friendship is twice stronger than love :-)

The input will always be in lowercase and never be empty.

### Examples:  

```ruby
  Test.assert_equals(words_to_marks("attitude"), 100)
  Test.assert_equals(words_to_marks("friends"), 75)
  Test.assert_equals(words_to_marks("family"), 66)
  Test.assert_equals(words_to_marks("selfness"), 99)
  Test.assert_equals(words_to_marks("knowledge"), 96)
  ```
