### Directions:

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

### Examples:

```ruby
Test.assert_equals(get_middle("test"),"es")
Test.assert_equals(get_middle("testing"),"t")
Test.assert_equals(get_middle("middle"),"dd")
Test.assert_equals(get_middle("A"),"A")
Test.assert_equals(get_middle("of"),"of")
```
